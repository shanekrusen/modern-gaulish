			<h1>Welcome to the homepage of Galáthach hAthevíu, the modern Gaulish language.</h1>
			<br />
			<p>The Gaulish language is the earliest recorded language of western Europe, and can therefore be considered its aboriginal language. It is a Celtic language closely related to Welsh, Cornish and Breton, and more distantly to Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. It became extinct in the middle ages, and is currently undergoing a revival. This website presents to the world the complete grammar of the modernised and revived 21st century version of the Gaulish language. Enjoy.</p>
